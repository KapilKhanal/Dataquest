    "\n",
    "In order to figure out whether to study past questions, study general knowledge, or not study it all, it would be helpful to figure out two things:\n",

    " - How often the answer is deducible from the question.\n",
    " - How often new questions are repeats of older questions.\n",
    " \n",
    "You can answer the second question by seeing how often complex words (> 6 characters) reoccur. You can answer the first question by seeing how many times words in the answer also occur in the question. We'll work on the first question now, and come back to the second.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Write a function that takes in a row in jeopardy, as a Series. It should:\n",
    "   - Split the `clean_answer` column around spaces and assign to the variable `split_answer`.\n",
    "   - Split the `clean_question` column around spaces and assign to the variable `split_question`.\n",
    "   - Create a variable called `match_count`, and set it to `0`.\n",
    "   - If `the` is in `split_answer`, remove it using the `remove` method on lists. `The` is commonly found in answers and questions, but doesn't have any meaningful use in finding the answer.\n",
    "   - If the length of `split_answer` is 0, return 0. This prevents a division by zero error later.\n",
    "   - Loop through each item in `split_answer`, and see if it occurs in `split_question`. If it does, add 1 to `match_count`.\n",
    "   - Divide `match_count` by the length of `split_answer`, and return the result.\n",
    "   - Count how many times terms in `clean_answer` occur in `clean_question`.\n",
    "   - Use the Pandas `DataFrame.apply` method to apply the function to each row in jeopardy.\n",
    "   - Pass the `axis=1` argument to apply the function across each row.\n",
    "   - Assign the result to the `answer_in_question` column.\n",

    "To do this, we can:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Sort jeopardy in order of ascending air date.\n",
    " - Maintain a set called `terms_used` that will be empty initially.\n",
    " - Iterate through each row of jeopardy.\n",

    " - If it does, increment a counter.\n",
    " - Add each word to `terms_used`.\n",

    "This will enable us to check if the terms in questions have been used previously or not. Only looking at words greater than 6 characters enables us to filter out words like `the` and `than`, which are commonly used, but don't tell us a lot about a question."
